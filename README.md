## 🚀 About Me 
## 👨‍💻 From Edge AI to Backend Systems — Building What Scales

Most people see my resume and think "ML guy." But here's the truth: while I love working with cutting-edge AI, **my real passion is the infrastructure that makes it work at scale**.

**My journey so far:**

I started building systems that matter in environments where there's no room for error. At **Dtyle.AI**, I didn't just train models—I engineered **real-time edge AI pipelines** that fused vision, audio, and sensor data for maritime safety. The challenge? Making it work on edge devices with <300ms latency requirements. That's where I fell in love with **system design, optimization, and performance engineering**.

At **SmartScore**, I built preprocessing pipelines that handled 4,500+ handwritten samples, reducing noise by 45%. But the real win? Designing the **infrastructure** that let LLMs scale across education boards without breaking.

**What I'm really good at:**
- **Backend & distributed systems:** FastAPI async backends, Elasticsearch custom scoring, Redis caching
- **Building from scratch:** Launched 3 production systems from concept to deployment in fast-paced startup environments
- **Cross-functional collaboration:** Worked with PMs, designers, and researchers to ship features used by thousands
- **Performance optimization:** Sub-300ms retrieval, <3s notification latency, real-time processing at scale

**Why SDE roles?** Because the most exciting problems in tech today—whether it's Copilot, M365, or Google Cloud—aren't just about algorithms. They're about building **reliable, scalable infrastructure** that serves hundreds of millions of users. That's the work I want to do.

🎯 **Looking for:** Backend SDE, Infrastructure Engineer, or ML Systems roles where engineering excellence meets real-world impact.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On 

🏥 **MediLockr** — Patient-owned healthcare data exchange
- Building **zero-knowledge E2EE system** with client-side encryption and revocable permissions
- Implementing **hybrid search** (BM25 + vector embeddings) with sub-300ms retrieval using Elasticsearch
- Designing **async FastAPI backend** for multi-format document processing with LLM entity extraction

🌐 **Nayi Disha** — Disaster zone supply chain intelligence
- Developing **real-time risk calculation engine** with <3s notification latency
- Building **predictive ML models** for 72-hour weather forecasts with Redis caching (80-86% accuracy)
- Creating **route risk algorithms** that reduced routing uncertainty by 40%

🧠 **Deepening my systems knowledge:**
- Exploring **distributed systems patterns** and consensus algorithms
- Building **high-performance C++ applications** for low-latency scenarios
- Contributing to open-source projects focused on infrastructure and backend systems

📚 **Competitive Programming:** Maintaining 1500+ rating on Codeforces, solving 250+ problems on LeetCode

## 🌱 Currently Learning 

🔧 **Systems & Infrastructure:**
- **Distributed systems design:** Diving deep into consensus protocols, replication strategies, and fault tolerance
- **High-performance C++:** Modern C++20 features for system-level programming
- **Event-driven architectures:** Building scalable microservices with Kafka and Azure Event Hubs

☁️ **Cloud & DevOps:**
- **Kubernetes orchestration:** Container management and service mesh patterns
- **Azure ecosystem:** Exploring .NET/C# backend services for cloud-native applications
- **CI/CD at scale:** GitHub Actions, infrastructure as code with Terraform

⚡ **Performance Engineering:**
- **Low-level optimization:** Cache efficiency, memory management, and profiling
- **Database internals:** Understanding query optimization and storage engines
- **Network programming:** Building efficient client-server architectures

🎯 **Goal:** Bridge the gap between ML systems and production-grade backend engineering to build infrastructure that scales to millions of users.
