 <!-- About section -->
---

🌟 As a computer science engineering student specializing in AI and ML, I'm deeply passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences. My journey in complete web development has equipped me with versatile skills to craft dynamic and engaging digital experiences. 

🖥️ Additionally, my expertise extends to SEO and topics like search engine marketing, backed by certifications in these domains. 🔍 Looking ahead, I'm eager to delve into the realms of machine learning and deep learning, fueled by a curiosity to explore innovative solutions and algorithms. 🤖 When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll find me indulging in my love for reading or immersing myself in artsy pursuits. 

I'm dedicated to contributing positively to open and inclusive developer communities while advocating for accessibility across the web. ✨
